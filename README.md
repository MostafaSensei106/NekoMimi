# NekoMimi

A playful Flutter app that helps you ask your significant other the ultimate question: *"Do you love me?"* 

- If they answer "Yes" ❤️, they will receive an adorable message back: *"I love you too!"* 
- If they answer "No" 💔, the app will cheekily respond with *"You've been hacked!"* and display their IP address.

The app also includes support for both Dark Mode and Light Mode, wrapped in a cute, cat-themed interface! 🐾 #nekomimi
